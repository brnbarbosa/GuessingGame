# Simple Python Guessing Game 🐍

**Repository:** [https://github.com/brnbarbosa/GuessingGame](https://github.com/brnbarbosa/GuessingGame)

A fun and simple command-line number guessing game built with Python.

## Description

This project is a classic number guessing game where the computer generates a secret random integer within a defined range, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, letting the player know if their guess was too high, too low, or correct. After a successful guess, the player has the option to play again.

## Features ✨

*   Generates a random integer for the player to guess (e.g., between 1 and 100).
*   Prompts the user for integer input.
*   Provides feedback on each guess:
    *   "Too high!"
    *   "Too low!"
    *   "Correct!"
*   Basic input validation.

## Requirements 📋

*   Python 3.x
