# Simple Python Guessing Game 🐍

**Repository:** [https://github.com/brnbarbosa/GuessingGame](https://github.com/brnbarbosa/GuessingGame)

A fun and simple command-line number guessing game built with Python.

## Description

This project is a classic number guessing game where the computer generates a secret random integer within a defined range, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, letting the player know if their guess was too high, too low, or correct. After a successful guess, the player has the option to play again.

## Features ✨

*   Generates a random integer for the player to guess (e.g., between 1 and 100).
*   Prompts the user for integer input.
*   Provides feedback on each guess:
    *   "Too high!"
    *   "Too low!"
    *   "Correct!"
*   Keeps track of the number of guesses (Optional - you might add this feature later!).
*   Asks the player if they want to play another round after winning.
*   Basic input validation (handles non-integer inputs gracefully - Optional, but recommended!).

## Requirements 📋

*   Python 3.x

## Installation ⚙️

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/brnbarbosa/GuessingGame.git
    cd GuessingGame
    ```
    *Or simply download the `main.py` (or your script's name) file from the repository.*

2.  **No external libraries needed!** This game uses Python's built-in `random` module.

## How to Run ▶️

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned or saved the Python file (e.g., `GuessingGame`).
3.  Run the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *(Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your Python script if it's different.)*

## How to Play 🎮

1.  Run the script as described above.
2.  The game will prompt you: "Guess a number between 1 and 100:" (or your chosen range).
3.  Enter an integer and press Enter.
4.  The game will tell you if your guess is "Too high!", "Too low!", or "Correct!".
5.  Keep guessing based on the feedback until you guess the correct number.
6.  Once you guess correctly, the game will congratulate you and ask: "Do you want to play again? (yes/no):".
7.  Type `yes` to start a new game with a new random number, or `no` (or anything else) to exit.
